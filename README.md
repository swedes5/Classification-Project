# Mushroom-Classification-Project

There are 4 files in this repository:  
classification project.pdf (My presentation slides pdf version)  
classification write up.pdf (My write up pdf version)  
classification_mvp.ipynb (My mvp used at the halfway point of the project as a jupyter notebook)  
classification_project.ipynb (My project code that I gathered visuals from and have all the model code as a jupyter notebook)  


Here I used the [UCI Machine Learning Mushroom Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification?resource=download) dataset and
classified the mushrooms by edibility status (either edible or poisonous).  Using the detailed features I tried a few different methods of clustering and classifying
such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.  Since this is a nice balanced dataset, all the different models performed  very well
and a more interesting conclusion than which model performed best in this case was which feature was the most important to the model's decision.
