# Mushroom-Classification-Project

Here I used the [UCI Machine Learning Mushroom Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification?resource=download) dataset and
classified the mushrooms by edibility status (either edible or poisonous).  Using the detailed features I tried a few different methods of clustering and classifying
such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression.  Since this is a nice balanced dataset, all the different models performed  very well
and a more interesting conclusion than which model performed best in this case was which feature was the most important to the model's decision.
